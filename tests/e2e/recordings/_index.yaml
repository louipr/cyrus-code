  AI-recordable GUI exploration recordings for E2E tests.
  Each recording captures knowledge about how to interact with
  specific parts of the application.

# How to use recordings:
#
# 1. In tests:
#    import { RecordingPlayer } from './recordings/lib';
#    const player = new RecordingPlayer(page);
#    const result = await player.run('drawio/export-png');
#
# 2. To create new recordings:
#    import { RecordingBuilder } from './recordings/lib';
#    const builder = new RecordingBuilder('my-feature')
#      .setContext({ app: 'my-app' })
#      .addTask('step-1', 'First step')
#        .click('.button', 'Click the button to start')
#        .waitFor('.result', 'Wait for result to appear')
#      .save('my-app/my-feature.yaml');
#
# 3. For AI agents exploring:
#    - Read this index to discover available patterns
#    - Use RecordingPlayer to replay known patterns
#    - Use RecordingBuilder to capture new knowledge
