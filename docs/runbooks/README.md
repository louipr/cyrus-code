# Runbooks

Operational procedures for common development tasks.

## Available Runbooks

| Runbook | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [verify-help-content.md](verify-help-content.md) | Verify help dialog renders correctly after C4/docs changes |

## When to Use Runbooks

Runbooks capture repeatable workflows that:
- Involve multiple steps
- Are easy to forget or do inconsistently
- Have been done incorrectly before

## Adding New Runbooks

1. Create `docs/runbooks/<task-name>.md`
2. Include: When to Use, Steps, Common Issues
3. Add to this README
