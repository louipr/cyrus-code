context:
  app: cyrus-code
  prerequisites:
    - App is launched
    - Diagram view is available
  notes: |
    This macro demonstrates a typical draw.io workflow:
    1. Add first shape
    2. Add second shape
    3. Connect them with an arrow

    Implementation requires draw.io IPC integration to
    programmatically insert and manipulate shapes.

steps:
  - action: wait
    timeout: 1000
    expect:
      selector: "[data-testid='view-toggle']"
      assert: exists
    why: Wait for app to be ready

  - action: click
    selector: "[data-testid='view-toggle'] button:has-text('Diagram')"
    why: Switch to diagram view

  - action: wait
    timeout: 2000
    expect:
      selector: "[data-testid='diagram-webview']"
      assert: exists
    why: Wait for Draw.io webview to load

  - action: wait
    timeout: 500
    why: Wait for shapes to be inserted (requires draw.io IPC integration)

  - action: wait
    timeout: 500
    why: Wait for connection to be created (requires draw.io IPC integration)
